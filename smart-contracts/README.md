## Overview

The smart contracts in this directory form the backbone of the Demarket platform, handling crucial functionalities such as:

- User registration and authentication
- Listing and purchasing of items
- Token transactions (if applicable)
- Dispute resolution mechanisms

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.0.0 or later)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)
- Truffle Suite (`npm install -g truffle`)
- Ganache (for local blockchain development)

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Start Ganache or connect to your preferred Ethereum network.

3. Configure `truffle-config.js` with your network settings.

## Compiling Contracts

Compile the smart contracts using Truffle:

## Testing

Run the test suite to ensure all contracts are functioning as expected:

Replace `<network_name>` with the name of the network you've configured in `truffle-config.js`.

## Contract Interactions

(Provide examples of how to interact with your main contracts, e.g., creating a listing, making a purchase, etc.)

## Security Considerations

- All contracts have been thoroughly tested, but use at your own risk.
- Consider getting a professional audit before deploying to mainnet.
- Implement access controls and use `require` statements to validate inputs.

## Gas Optimization

- Contracts have been optimized for gas efficiency.
- Consider using events for less critical data storage.
